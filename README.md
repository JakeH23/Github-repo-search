## GitHub Repo Search App

A single page web application that utilises GitHub APIs to allow a user to search for a repository by name.

Users can also see a more detailed view of a repository. This detailed view includes the username of the repo's creator, a link to the repo URL, the repo description, the amount of times it has been forked, how many open issues it has and when it was last updated.

The app is built in React and uses Bootstrap as its CSS framework.

Web App is deployed here -> https://githubreposearch.netlify.com/
